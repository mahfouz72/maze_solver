Maze Solver Program
This program is designed to solve a maze represented as a grid using two popular graph search algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). It takes a maze grid as input file, where each cell can be either a wall (represented by '#') or a path (represented by '.'). The program finds the path from the start cell to the goal cell('E'), if one exists, and outputs the path as a sequence of coordinates. To run the program, follow these steps:

Prepare your maze grid by creating a text file (.txt) where each line represents a row in the maze. Use the following symbols:

'#' to represent a wall (blocked cell). '.' (dot) to represent a path (open cell). 'S' to represent the start cell. 'E' to represent the goal cell.
